# SAE302 ChatRT

The ChatRT is a real-time chat application that allows users to chat with each other in real-time. The application is built using the following technologies:
- TCP exchange protocol
- JAVAFX
- Java 8
- Maven

## Getting Started

When you launch the application, you will be asked to enter your username. Then you will be able to choose a room to join. You can create a room or join an existing one. Once you are in a room, you can chat with other users in real-time.
The contacts list is on the left side of the application. When a user is connected, you can see his avatar and nickname. 
## Versioning

We use gricad-gitlab for versioning.
